Puppet::Type.newtype(:gcompute_route) do
  @doc = <<-DOC
    Represents a Route resource. A route is a rule that specifies how certain
    packets should be handled by the virtual network. Routes are associated
    with virtual machines by tag, and the set of routes for a particular
    virtual machine is called its routing table. For each packet leaving a
    virtual machine, the system searches that virtual machine's routing table
    for a single best matching route. Routes match packets by destination IP
    address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones. If
    there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority
    value. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet
    headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is
    then forwarded as specified by the next_hop field of the winning route --
    either to another virtual machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or
    a Compute Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in
    the sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped. A Routes
    resources must have exactly one specification of either nextHopGateway,
    nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, or nextHopVpnTunnel.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.

      of two routes with equal prefix length, the one with the lowest-numbered
      priority value wins. Default value is 1000. Valid range is 0 through
