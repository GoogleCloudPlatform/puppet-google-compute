    Represents an Address resource. Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP
    address and, optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on the same
    network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To communicate with the Internet and
    instances outside of the same network, you must specify the instance's external IP address.
    Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for the lifetime of the
    instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated, the instance is assigned a new internal IP
    address, either by Compute Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
    static.
