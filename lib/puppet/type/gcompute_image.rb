  @doc = <<-DOC
    Represents an Image resource. Google Compute Engine uses operating system
    images to create the root persistent disks for your instances. You specify
    an image when you create an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an
    operating system, and a root file system. Linux operating system images are
    also capable of running containers on Compute Engine. Images can be either
    public or custom. Public images are provided and maintained by Google,
    open-source communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects
    have access to these images and can use them to create instances. Custom
    images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
    from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image to
    create an instance.

      A list of features to enable on the guest OS. Applicable for bootable
      images only. Currently, only one feature can be enabled,
      VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE, which allows each virtual CPU to have its own
      queue. For Windows images, you can only enable VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE on
      images with driver version 1.2.0.1621 or higher. Linux images with kernel
      versions 3.17 and higher will support VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE. For new
      Windows images, the server might also populate this field with the value
      WINDOWS, to indicate that this is a Windows image. This value is purely
      informational and does not enable or disable any features.

      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.
