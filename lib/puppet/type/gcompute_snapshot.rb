    Represents a Persistent Disk Snapshot resource. Use snapshots to back up data from your
    persistent disks. Snapshots are different from public images and custom images, which are used
    primarily to create instances or configure instance templates. Snapshots are useful for
    periodic backup of the data on your persistent disks. You can create snapshots from persistent
    disks even while they are attached to running instances. Snapshots are incremental, so you can
    create regular snapshots on a persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you
    regularly created a full image of the disk.
