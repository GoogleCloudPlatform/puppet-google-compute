    Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to the physical disks in a
    desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the hardware behind these devices to ensure data
    redundancy and optimize performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
    hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD). Persistent disks are located independently
    from your virtual machine instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your
    data even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales automatically
    with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks or add more persistent disks to an
    instance to meet your performance and storage space requirements. Add a persistent disk to your
    instance when you need reliable and affordable storage with consistent performance
    characteristics.

      Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key. After you encrypt a disk with a
      customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to
      create a disk snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
      Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk. If you do
      not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk will be encrypted using
      an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

      The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact image
      that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk
      from an image that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source image ID
      would identify the exact version of the image that was used.

      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
      letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

      Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field when creating a
      persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to
      create an empty persistent disk. If you specify this field along with sourceImage or
      sourceSnapshot, the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the
      size of the snapshot.

  newproperty(:source_image, parent: Google::Compute::Property::String) do

      The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is deleted, this field will
      not be set. To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the
      image by its family name. For example, specify family/debian-8 to use the latest Debian 8
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-8 Alternatively, use a specific
      version of a public operating system image:
      projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-8-jessie-vYYYYMMDD To create a disk with a private
      image that you created, specify the image name in the following format:
      global/images/my-private-image You can also specify a private image by its image family,
      which returns the latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with
      family/family-name: global/images/family/my-private-family
