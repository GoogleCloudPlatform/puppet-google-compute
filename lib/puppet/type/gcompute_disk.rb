    Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to the
    physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
    hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
    performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard hard
    disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD). Persistent disks are located
    independently from your virtual machine instances, so you can detach or
    move persistent disks to keep your data even after you delete your
    instances. Persistent disk performance scales automatically with size, so
    you can resize your existing persistent disks or add more persistent disks
    to an instance to meet your performance and storage space requirements. Add
    a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and affordable
    storage with consistent performance characteristics.

      Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key. After you
      encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same
      key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk snapshot or an
      image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine). Customer-supplied
      encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk. If you do
      not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk will
      be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to
      provide a key to use the disk later.

  newparam(:source_image_id, parent: Google::Compute::Property::String) do
    desc <<-DOC
      The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value identifies
      the exact image that was used to create this persistent disk. For
      example, if you created the persistent disk from an image that was later
      deleted and recreated under the same name, the source image ID would
      identify the exact version of the image that was used.

      The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value

      disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
      that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
      snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was
      used.

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.

  newproperty(:size_gb, parent: Google::Compute::Property::Integer) do

      Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field
      when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot
      parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk. If you
      specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot, the value of
      sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the size of
      the snapshot.

  newproperty(:source_image, parent: Google::Compute::Property::String) do

      The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is
      deleted, this field will not be set. To create a disk with one of the
      public operating system images, specify the image by its family name. For
      example, specify family/debian-8 to use the latest Debian 8 image:
      projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-8 Alternatively, use a
      specific version of a public operating system image:
      projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-8-jessie-vYYYYMMDD To create a
      disk with a private image that you created, specify the image name in the
      following format: global/images/my-private-image You can also specify a
      private image by its image family, which returns the latest version of
      the image in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name:
      global/images/family/my-private-family
