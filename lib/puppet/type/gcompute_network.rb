    Represents a Network resource. Your Cloud Platform Console project can
    contain multiple networks, and each network can have multiple instances
    attached to it. A network allows you to define a gateway IP and the network
    range for the instances attached to that network. Every project is provided
    with a default network with preset configurations and firewall rules. You
    can choose to customize the default network by adding or removing rules, or
    you can create new networks in that project. Generally, most users only
    need one network, although you can have up to five networks per project by
    default. A network belongs to only one project, and each instance can only
    belong to one network. All Compute Engine networks use the IPv4 protocol.
    Compute Engine currently does not support IPv6. However, Google is a major
    advocate of IPv6 and it is an important future direction.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.
