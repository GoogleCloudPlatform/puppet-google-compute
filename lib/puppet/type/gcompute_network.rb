    Represents a Network resource. Your Cloud Platform Console project can contain multiple
    networks, and each network can have multiple instances attached to it. A network allows you to
    define a gateway IP and the network range for the instances attached to that network. Every
    project is provided with a default network with preset configurations and firewall rules. You
    can choose to customize the default network by adding or removing rules, or you can create new
    networks in that project. Generally, most users only need one network, although you can have up
    to five networks per project by default. A network belongs to only one project, and each
    instance can only belong to one network. All Compute Engine networks use the IPv4 protocol.
    Compute Engine currently does not support IPv6. However, Google is a major advocate of IPv6 and
    it is an important future direction.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be

      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
      letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
