    Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the
    instances. All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked
    by the firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it. The default
    network has automatically created firewall rules that are shown in default
    firewall rules. No manually created network has automatically created
    firewall rules except for a default "allow" rule for outgoing traffic and a
    default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all networks except the default
    network, you must create any firewall rules you need.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.

      URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when

      global/networks/default If you choose to specify this property, you can
      specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following
      are all valid URLs:
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/

      If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
      that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be
      expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may
      be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic
      that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that
      belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does
      not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only IPv4 is
      supported.

  end

  newproperty(:source_tags, parent: Google::Compute::Property::StringArray) do
    desc <<-DOC
      If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
      with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source tags
      cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address.
      Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP address. One or
      both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are
      set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within
      sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the
      sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both
      properties for the firewall to apply.

  newproperty(:target_tags, parent: Google::Compute::Property::StringArray) do
    desc <<-DOC
      A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the
      network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[]. If
      no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances
      on the specified network.
