Puppet::Type.newtype(:gcompute_instance_group_manager) do
  @doc = <<-DOC
    Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in
    the request. After the group is created, it schedules an action to create
    instances in the group using the specified instance template. This
    operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the instances
    in the group have not yet been created. You must separately verify the
    status of the individual instances. A managed instance group can have up to
    1000 VM instances per group.
