      The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
      Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
      scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional). When the
      load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the
      address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the
      address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this
      field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or
      regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4
      only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6. When the
      load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP
      address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding
      rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP
      address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet
      or network configured for this forwarding rule. An address can be
      specified either by a literal IP address or a URL reference to an
      existing Address resource. The following examples are all valid: *
      100.1.2.3 * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project
      /regions/region/addresses/address *
      projects/project/regions/region/addresses/address *

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,

      This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,

      TargetPool, TargetInstance. Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP,

      forwarded to target. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress,
      IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges. Some types of forwarding
      target have constraints on the acceptable ports: * TargetHttpProxy: 80,
      8080 * TargetHttpsProxy: 443 * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195,

      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing. When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a single port or a
      comma separated list of ports can be configured. Only packets addressed
      to these ports will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
      forwarding rule. You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports.
