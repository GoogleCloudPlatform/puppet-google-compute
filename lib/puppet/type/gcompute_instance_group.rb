    Represents an Instance Group resource. Instance groups are self-managed and can contain
    identical or different instances. Instance groups do not use an instance template. Unlike
    managed instance groups, you must create and add instances to an instance group manually.

      Assigns a name to a port number. For example: {name: "http", port: 80}. This allows the
      system to reference ports by the assigned name instead of a port number. Named ports can also
      contain multiple ports. For example: [{name: "http", port: 80},{name: "http", port: 8080}]
      Named ports apply to all instances in this instance group.
