# Returns the IP address associated with the Address managed by a
# `gcompute_address` resource.
#
# Arguments:
#   - name: string
#     the name of the address resource
#   - region: string
#     the region where the address resource is allocated
#   - project: string
#     the project name where resource is allocated
#   - cred: authorization
#     the credential to use to authorize the information request
#
# Examples:
#   - gcompute_address_ip('my-server', 'us-central1', 'myproject', $fn_auth)
#
# The credential parameter should be allocated with a
# `gauth_credential_*_for_function` call.
