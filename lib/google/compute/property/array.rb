        # When the user specifies an array for a property Puppet by default
        # ensures that at least 1 of the values match. This is useful when you
        # have various options and any match is good, e.g. various possible file
        # sources, say from Corp or Internet.
        #
        # However our arrays require that all values match so we define the
        # array_matching = :all to instruct Puppet to do this. This could have
        # been specified in the Puppet::Type, but putting it here makes it
        # simpler to not "forget" to define it.
