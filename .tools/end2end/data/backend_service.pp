# Defines a credential to be used when communicating with Google Cloud
# Platform. The title of this credential is then used as the 'credential'
# parameter in the gdns_managed_zone type.
#
# For more information on the gauth_credential parameters and providers please
# refer to its detailed documentation at:
#
#   https://forge.puppet.com/google/gauth
#
# For the sake of this example we set the parameter 'path' to point to the file
# that contains your credential in JSON format. And for convenience this example
# allows a variable named $cred_path to be provided to it. If running from the
# command line you can pass it via Facter:
#
#   FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json \
#       puppet apply .tools/end2end/data/backend_service.pp
#
# For convenience you optionally can add it to your ~/.bash_profile (or the
# respective .profile settings) environment:
#
#   export FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json
#
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute',
  ],
