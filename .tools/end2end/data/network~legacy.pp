# Getting Started
# ---------------
# The following example requires two environment variables to be set:
#     * cred_path - a path to a JSON service account file
#     * project - the name of your GCP project
#
# If running from the command line you can pass these via Facter:
#
#   FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json \
#   FACTER_project='my-test-project'
#       puppet apply .tools/end2end/data/network~legacy.pp
#
# For convenience you optionally can add it to your ~/.bash_profile (or the
# respective .profile settings) environment:
#
#   export FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json
#   export FACTER_project='my-test-project'
#
# Authenticating to GCP
# ---------------------
# `gauth_credential` defines a credential to be used when communicating with
# Google Cloud Platform.
#
# For more information on the gauth_credential parameters and providers please
# refer to its detailed documentation at:
#
#   https://forge.puppet.com/google/gauth
#
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute',
  ],
}

notice('Creating network in Legacy mode')
gcompute_network { "puppet-e2e-mynetwork-${network_id}":
  # On a legacy network you cannot specify the auto_create_subnetworks
  # parameter.
  # | auto_create_subnetworks => false,
