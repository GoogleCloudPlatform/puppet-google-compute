### Classes

#### Public classes

* [`gcompute_network`](#gcompute_network):
    Represents a Network resource.
    Your Cloud Platform Console project can contain multiple networks, and
    each network can have multiple instances attached to it. A network
    allows
    you to define a gateway IP and the network range for the instances
    attached to that network. Every project is provided with a default
    network
    with preset configurations and firewall rules. You can choose to
    customize
    the default network by adding or removing rules, or you can create new
    networks in that project. Generally, most users only need one network,
    although you can have up to five networks per project by default.
    A network belongs to only one project, and each instance can only
    belong
    to one network. All Compute Engine networks use the IPv4 protocol.
    Compute
    Engine currently does not support IPv6. However, Google is a major
    advocate of IPv6 and it is an important future direction.

### Parameters

#### `gcompute_network`

##### `description`

  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
  you create the resource.

##### `gateway_ipv4`

  A gateway address for default routing to other networks. This value is
  read only and is selected by the Google Compute Engine, typically as
  the first usable address in the IPv4Range.

##### `id`

  Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.

##### `ipv4_range`

  The range of internal addresses that are legal on this network. This
  range is a CIDR specification, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. Provided
  by the client when the network is created.

##### `name`

  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

##### `subnetworks`

  Server-defined fully-qualified URLs for all subnetworks in this
  network.

##### `auto_create_subnetworks`

  When set to true, the network is created in "auto subnet mode". When
  set to false, the network is in "custom subnet mode".
  In "auto subnet mode", a newly created network is assigned the default
  CIDR of 10.128.0.0/9 and it automatically creates one subnetwork per
  region.

##### `creation_timestamp`

  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

## Limitations

This module has been tested on:

* RedHat 6, 7
* CentOS 6, 7
* Debian 7, 8
* Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04, 16.10
* SLES 11-sp4, 12-sp2
* openSUSE 13

Testing on other platforms has been minimal and cannot be guaranteed.
